VyOS is a fully open-source Linux-based OS for network devices. It focuses on enterprise, service provider, and network geek audiences and includes:

* Multiple dynamic routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, PIM-SM...);
* Multiple VPNs (L2TP, WireGuard, IPsec, DMVPN...);
* Stateful configuration systems with commit/rollback and versioning functionality;
* A remote HTTP API and scripting APIs for shell and Python.

Our business model is "pay for prebuilt binaries", plus technical support and custom development services.
